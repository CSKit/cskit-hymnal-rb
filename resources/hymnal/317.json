{"number":317,"title":"STRENGTH AND STAY","composer":"John B. Dykes","verses":[["Still, still with Thee when purple morning breaketh,","When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee,","Fairer than morning, lovelier than the daylight,","Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee."],["Alone with Thee, amid the changing shadows,","Solemn the hush of nature, newly born;","Alone with Thee, in breathless adoration,","In the calm dew and freshness of the morn."],["So shall it ever be in the bright morning,","When hearts awaking see the shadows flee,","O, in that hour, and fairer than the dawning,","Rises the glorious thought, I am with Thee."]]}
