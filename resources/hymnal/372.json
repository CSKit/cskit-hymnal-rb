Sullivan","verses":[["We may not climb the heavenly steeps","To bring the Lord Christ down;","In vain we search the lowest deeps,","For him no depths can drown:"],["But warm, sweet, tender, even yet","A present help is he;","And faith has yet its Olivet,","And love its Galilee."],["The healing of the seamless dress","Is by our beds of pain;","We touch him in life’s throng and press,","And we are whole again."],["O Lord and Master of us all,","Whate’er our name or sign,","We own thy sway, we hear thy call,","We test our lives by thine."]]}
