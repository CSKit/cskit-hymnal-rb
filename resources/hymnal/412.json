{"number":412,"title":"LONDONDERRY","composer":"Traditional Irish Melody","verses":[["O dreamer, leave thy dreams for joyful waking,","O captive, rise and sing, for thou art free;","The Christ is here, all dreams of error breaking,","Unloosing bonds of all captivity."],["He comes to bless thee on his wings of healing;","To banish pain, and wipe all tears away;","He comes anew, to humble hearts revealing","The mounting footsteps of the upward way."],["He comes to give thee joy for desolation,","Beauty for ashes of the vanished years;","For every tear to bring full compensation,","To give thee confidence for all thy fears."],["He comes to call the dumb to joyful singing;","The deaf to hear; the blinded eyes to see;","The glorious tidings of salvation bringing.","O captive, rise, thy Saviour comes to thee."]]}
