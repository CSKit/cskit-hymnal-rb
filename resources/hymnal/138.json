{"number":138,"title":"FESTUS","composer":"From a German Chorale","verses":[["I praise Thee, Lord, for blessings sent","To break the dream of human power;","For now, my shallow cistern spent,","I find Thy font and thirst no more."],["I take Thy hand and fears grow still;","Behold Thy face and doubts remove;","Who would not yield his wavering will","To perfect Truth and boundless Love?"],["That Truth gives promise of a dawn","Beneath whose light I am to see,","When all these blinding veils are drawn,","Thy love has always guided me."]]}
