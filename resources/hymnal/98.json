{"number":97,"title":"ILSLEYIN BABILONE","composer":"Frank G. IlsleyDutch Traditional Melody","verses":[["He that goeth forth with weeping,","Bearing still the precious seed,","Never tiring, never sleeping,","Soon shall see his toil succeed;","Showers of rain will fall from heaven,","Then the cheering sun will shine;","So shall plenteous fruit be given,","Through an influence all divine."],["Sow thy seed, be never weary,","Let not fear thy thoughts employ;","Though the prospect seem most dreary,","Thou shalt reap the fruits of joy:","Lo, the scene of verdure brightening,","See the rising grain appear;","Look again, the fields are whitening,","Harvest time is surely here."]]}
