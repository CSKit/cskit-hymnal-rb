{"number":69,"title":"SONG 24","composer":"Orlando Gibbons","verses":[["Give me, O Lord, an understanding heart,","That I may learn to know myself in Thee,","To spurn the wrong and choose the better part","And thus from sinful bondage be set free."],["Give me, O Lord, a meek and contrite heart,","That I may learn to quell all selfish pride,","Bowing before Thee, see Thee as Thou art","And â€™neath Thy sheltering presence safely hide."],["Give me, O Lord, a gentle, loving heart,","That I may learn to be more tender, kind,","And with Thy healing touch, each wound and smart","With Christly bands of Love and Truth to bind."]]}
