{"number":99,"title":"BERA","composer":"John E. Gould, arr. by W. E. Young","verses":[["He that hath God his guardian made,","Shall underneath th’ Almighty’s shade","Fearless and undisturbed abide;","Thus to myself of Him I’ll say,","He is my fortress, shield and stay,","My God; in Him I will confide."],["His tender love and watchful care","Shall free thee from the fowler’s snare,","From every harm and pestilence.","He over thee His wings shall spread","To cover thy unguarded head.","His truth shall be thy strong defense."],["He gives His angels charge o’er thee,","No evil therefore shalt thou see;","Thy refuge shall be God most high;","Dwelling within His secret place,","Thou shalt behold His power and grace,","See His salvation ever nigh."]]}
