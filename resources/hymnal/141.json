Weyse","verses":[["If the Lord build not the house","They that labor build in vain;","Father, may our corner stone","Stand foursquare, without a stain."],["Make our planting timely, true,","Governed by a power benign;","Nourish by a heavenly dew","All the branches and the vine."],["Fruitful shall our tillage be,","Known the work of perfect Mind,","Leaves be gathered from the tree","For the healing of mankind."],["Cleansing men of fear and hate,","Lifting hope above the sod,","Truth will summon, soon or late,","All the earth to worship God."]]}
