{"number":2,"title":"MISSIONARY HYMN","composer":"Lowell Mason","verses":[["A glorious day is dawning,","And o’er the waking earth","The heralds of the morning","Are springing into birth.","In dark and hidden places","There shines the blessed light;","The beam of Truth displaces","The darkness of the night."],["The advocates of error","Foresee the glorious morn,","And hear in shrinking terror,","The watchword of reform:","It rings from hill and valley,","It breaks oppression’s chain.","A thousand freemen rally,","And swell the mighty strain."],["The watchword has been spoken,","The light has broken forth,","Far shines the blessed token","Upon the startled earth.","To hearts and homes benighted","The blessed Truth is given,","And peace and love, united,","Point upward unto heaven."]]}
