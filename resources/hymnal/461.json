In every place,","every direction, everywhere,","Spirit is there."],["Whether we turn to left or right,","to north or south or east or west,","we meet with Love—and we are blessed.","Upward or down, below, above,","we meet with Love."],["Whether we plunge to ocean trench","or plot our course for farthest space,","Love’s law controls. Whatever race","we enter toward whatever goals,","Love’s law controls."],["Whether we build for centuries hence","or let tomorrow bound our aim,","God sets the pace. Always the same,","with instant and eternal grace,","God sets the pace."]]}
