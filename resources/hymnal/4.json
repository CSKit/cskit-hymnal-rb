{"number":4,"title":"PATER NOSTER","composer":"Percy C. Buck","verses":[["A holy air is breathing round,","A fragrance from above:","Be every thought from sense unbound,","Be every action love."],["O God, unite us heart to heart,","In sympathy divine,","That we be never drawn apart,","To love not Thee nor Thine;"],["But by the life of Jesus taught,","And all his gracious word,","Be nearer to each other brought,","And nearer Thee, O Lord."]]}
