Dykes","verses":[["The King of Love my Shepherd is,","Whose goodness faileth never;","I nothing lack, for I am His","And He is mine forever."],["Where streams of living water flow","My ransomed soul He leadeth,","And where the verdant pastures grow,","With food celestial feedeth."],["Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,","But yet in love He sought me,","And on His shoulder gently laid,","And home, rejoicing, brought me."],["And so through all the length of days","Thy goodness faileth never;","Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise","Within Thy house forever."]]}
