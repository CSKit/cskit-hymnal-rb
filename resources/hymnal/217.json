{"number":217,"title":"SECCOMB","composer":"Charles H. Morse","verses":[["O, he whom Jesus loved has truly spoken,","That holier worship, which God deigns to bless,","Restores the lost, and heals the spirit broken,","And feeds the widow and the fatherless."],["Then, brother man, fold to thy heart thy brother,","For where love dwells, the peace of God is there:","To worship rightly is to love each other;","Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer."],["Follow with reverent steps the great example","Of him whose holy work was doing good;","So shall the wide earth seem our Fatherâ€™s temple,","Each loving life a psalm of gratitude."]]}
