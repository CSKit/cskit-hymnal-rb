Hopkins","verses":[["Scorn not the slightest word or deed,","Nor deem it void of power;","Thereâ€™s fruit in each wind-wafted seed","That waits its natal hour."],["No act falls fruitless; none can tell","How vast its power may be","Nor what results enfolded dwell","Within it silently."],["A whispered word may touch the heart","And call it back to life;","A look of love bid sin depart","And still unholy strife."],["Work and despair not; bring thy mite,","Nor care how small it be;","God is with all that serve the right,","The holy, true, and free."]]}
