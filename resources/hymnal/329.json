{"number":329,"title":"ST. ANSELM","composer":"Joseph Barnby","verses":[["The heavens declare the glory","Of Him who made all things;","Each day repeats the story,","Each night its tribute brings.","To earth’s remotest border","His mighty power is known;","In beauty, grandeur, order,","His handiwork is shown."],["His law man’s pathway brightens,","His judgments all are pure,","His Word the thought enlightens,","And ever shall endure.","To heed His testimony,","And Wisdom’s way to hold,","Is sweeter far than honey,","And better far than gold."],["In daily contemplation","Of Thee, I take delight;","O, let my meditation","Lay hold of Thee aright.","O, aid me in suppression","Of idle thought or word;","O, keep me from transgression,","Redeemer, strength, and Lord."]]}
