{"number":134,"title":"WESSEX","composer":"Edward J. Hopkins","verses":[["I look to Thee in every need,","And never look in vain;","I feel Thy touch, eternal Love,","And all is well again:","The thought of Thee is mightier far","Than sin and pain and sorrow are."],["Thy calmness bends serene above,","My restlessness to still;","Around me flows Thy quickening life","To nerve my faltering will:","Thy presence fills my solitude;","Thy providence turns all to good."],["Embosomed deep in Thy dear love,","Held in Thy law, I stand:","Thy hand in all things I behold,","And all things in Thy hand.","Thou leadest me by unsought ways,","Thou turnâ€™st my mourning into praise."]]}
