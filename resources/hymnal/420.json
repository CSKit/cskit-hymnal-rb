{"number":420,"title":"COMPASSION","composer":"C. B. Rich","verses":[["So brightly burns Love’s holy glow,","So constant shines its light,","That none can claim he doth not know","The pathway through the night,","For see, ’tis lit by Love divine","To trace for us His wise design."],["The lambs who wander by the way,","He taketh in His arm;","For in the darkness they did stray","Unconscious of their harm:","So cometh He to all who roam,","To lead them safely, surely home."],["To God then praises let us sing","With glad and willing mind","For all the gifts His hand doth bring","To us and all mankind:","Forever doth His gift of love","Pour warmth and radiance from above."]]}
