{"number":195,"title":"ALL SOULS","composer":"John Yoakley","verses":[["Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art;","That, that alone can be my soul’s true rest;","Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart,","And stills the tumult of my troubled breast."],["Girt with the love of God, on every side,","I breathe that love as heaven’s own healing air;","I work and pray, and follow still my guide,","And fear no foe, escaping every snare."],["’Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God,","That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song;","Thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod;","I lean on Thee, in weakness I am strong."]]}
