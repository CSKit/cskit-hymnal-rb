{"number":335,"title":"MORNING LIGHT","composer":"George J. Webb","verses":[["The morning light is breaking,","The darkness disappears;","The sons of earth are waking","To penitential tears.","Each breeze that sweeps the ocean","Brings tidings from afar,","Of nations in commotion,","Prepared for Zionâ€™s war."],["Blest river of salvation,","Pursue thine onward way;","Flow thou to every nation,","Nor in thy richness stay:","Stay not till all the lowly","Triumphant reach their home:","Stay not till all the holy","Proclaim, The Lord is come."]]}
