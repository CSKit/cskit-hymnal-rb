Allen","verses":[["God is with me, gently oâ€™er me","Are His wings of mercy spread;","All His way made plain before me,","And His glory round me shed.","Safely onward","Shall my pilgrim feet be led."],["God is with me, and His presence","Shall my perfect guidance be,","Till my heart that peace inherit","God alone can give to me.","His all-power","Helps and heals, and sets me free."]]}
