{"number":379,"title":"RATHBUNCOURAGE","composer":"Ithamar ConkeyUniversity of Wales, arr. by H. Walford Davies","verses":[["Well for him who, all things losing,","E’en himself doth count as naught,","Still the one thing needful choosing","That with all true bliss is fraught."],["Well for him who nothing knoweth","But his God, whose boundless love","Makes the heart wherein it gloweth","Calm and pure and faithful prove."],["Well for him who, all forsaking,","Walketh not in shadows vain,","But the path of peace is taking","Through the vale of tears and pain."],["O that we our hearts might sever","From earth’s tempting vanities,","Fixing them on Him forever","In whom all our fullness lies."]]}
