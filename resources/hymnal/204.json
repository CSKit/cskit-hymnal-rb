{"number":204,"title":"THY KINGDOM COME","composer":"Gunnar Wennerberg","verses":[["O Father, Thy kingdom is come upon earth,","Thou rulest in all Thy creation;","Thou sendest Thy witnesses, telling Thy worth,","To call and entreat every nation,","With news of Thy mighty salvation."],["They lift up a light amid shadows of fear,","And Love is Thy banner above them;","No trouble shall touch them, no foes that appear","Shall e’er from their loyalty move them;","’Tis Thou dost uphold and approve them."],["They go in Thy strength, and they speak in Thy name,","With power of Thy promise forth faring,","And during the battle the victory claim,—","Their trust in Thy truth is their daring,","Salvation to all men declaring."]]}
