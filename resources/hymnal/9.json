{"number":9,"title":"CAROL","composer":"Arranged from David G. Corner","verses":[["All glory be to God most high,","And on the earth be peace,","The angels sang, in days of yore,","The song that ne’er shall cease,","Till all the world knows peace."],["God’s angels ever come and go,","All winged with light and love;","They bring us blessings from on high,","They lift our thoughts above,","They whisper God is Love."],["O longing hearts that wait on God","Through all the world so wide;","He knows the angels that you need,","And sends them to your side,","To comfort, guard and guide."],["O wake and hear the angel-song","That bids all discord cease,","From pain and sorrow, doubt and fear,","It brings us sweet release;","And so our hearts find peace."]]}
