{"number":5,"title":"FOREST GREEN","composer":"English Traditional Melody","verses":[["A voice from heaven we have heard,","The call to rise from earth;","Put armor on, the sword now gird,","And for the fight go forth.","The foe in ambush claims our prize,","Then heed high heavenâ€™s call.","Obey the voice of Truth, arise,","And let not fear enthrall."],["The cause requires unswerving might:","With God alone agree.","Then have no other aim than right;","End bondage, O be free.","Depart from sin, awake to love:","Your mission is to heal.","Then all of Truth you must approve,","And only know the real."]]}
