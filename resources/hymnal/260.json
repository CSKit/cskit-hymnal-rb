Anderson","verses":[["One thought I have, my ample creed,","So deep it is and broad,","And equal to my every need,—","It is the thought of God."],["Each morn unfolds His blessings new,","I take in trust my road;","And rising freshly to my view,","Shines forth the thought of God."],["To this their secret strength they owed,","The martyr’s path who trod;","The fountains of their patience flowed","From out their thought of God."],["Be still the light upon my way,","My pilgrim staff and rod,","My rest by night, my strength by day,","O blessed thought of God."]]}
