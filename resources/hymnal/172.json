{"number":172,"title":"EUCHARISTICA","composer":"Robert P. Stewart","verses":[["Lift up thy light, O man, arise and shine,","Steadfast while loud the storms of life assail;","Immortal ray of that great Light divine,","’Gainst whose all-power no tempest shall prevail."],["Hold high thy lamp above earth’s restless tides,","Beacon of hope to those who watch afar.","Falsehood and fear shall pass, but Truth abides;","Thine be the splendor of her deathless star."],["Should the world’s sin and sorrow round thee rave,","Pierce thou the dark with Truth’s undaunted ray,","Send out its light of joy to help and save,","That more and more shines to the perfect day."]]}
