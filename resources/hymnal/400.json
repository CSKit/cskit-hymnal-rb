Baker, arr.","verses":[["Ye timid saints, fresh courage take,","The clouds ye so much dread","Are big with mercy, and will break","In blessings on your head."],["His mighty purpose ripens fast,","Unfolding every hour;","The bud may have a bitter taste,","But sweet will be the flower."],["Blind unbelief is sure to err,","And scan His work in vain;","God is His own interpreter,","And He will make it plain."]]}
