{"number":29,"title":"EVERTON","composer":"Henry Smart","verses":[["Breaking through the clouds of darkness,","Black with error, doubt, and fear;","Lighting up each somber shadow,","With a radiance soft and clear;","Filling every heart with gladness,","That its holy power feels,","Comes the Christian Science gospel,","Sin it kills and grief it heals."],["Christlike in its benedictions,","Godlike in its strength sublime;","Conquering every subtle error,","With a meekness all divine,","It has gone across the ocean,","It is known in every land,","And our sisters and our brothers","Are united in one band."]]}
