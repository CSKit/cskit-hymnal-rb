SullivanOld English Melody","verses":[["Press on, dear traveler, press thou on,","I am the Way, the Truth, the Life.","It is the straight and narrow way","That leads to that eternal day,","That turns the darkness into light,","That buries wrong and honors right."],["Press on, and know that God is all;","He is the Life, the Truth, the Love.","It is the way the Saviour trod,","It is the way that leads to God.","Think of the words: No cross, no crown;","Though tasks are sore, be not cast down."]]}
