{"number":332,"title":"NESTLING","composer":"August H. Winding","verses":[["The Lord is in His holy place,","Let all the earth be still,","Be still and know that He is God,","And wait to do His will.","We need a sacred watchfulness,","An earnest deep desire for grace,","Our lives with true content to fill."],["So hear and heed His faithful Word,","And trust His promise long,","For they who seek Him Life shall find,","And shall in Him be strong;","We need a perfect faith in Him,","With understanding never dim,","To fill our daily lives with song."]]}
