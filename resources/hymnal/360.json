{"number":360,"title":"RUSTINGTON","composer":"C. Hubert H. Parry","verses":[["True, the heart grows rich in giving;","All its wealth is living grain;","Seeds which mildew in the garner,","Scattered, fill with gold the plain.","Is thy burden hard and heavy?","Do thy steps drag wearily?","Help to bear thy brotherâ€™s burden,","God will bear both it and thee."],["Is the heart a well left empty?","None but God its void can fill;","Nothing but a ceaseless fountain","Can its ceaseless longings still.","Is the heart a living power?","Self-entwined its strength sinks low;","It can only live in loving,","And, by serving, love will grow."]]}
