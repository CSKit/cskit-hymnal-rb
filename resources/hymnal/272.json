{"number":271,"title":"GONFALON ROYALTALLIS’ CANON","composer":"Percy C. BuckThomas Tallis","verses":[["Our God shall reign where’er the sun","Does his successive journeys run;","His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,","Till moons shall wax and wane no more."],["All people shall with joyful tongue","Dwell on His love with sweetest song,","And infant voices shall proclaim","Their early blessings on His name."],["For blessings flow where’er He reigns;","The prisoner leaps to loose his chains,","The weary find eternal rest,","And all the sons of want are blest."],["Let every creature rise, and bring","Peculiar honors to our King;","Let angel songs be heard again","And earth repeat the long Amen."]]}
