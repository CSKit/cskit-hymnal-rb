Oakeley","verses":[["Happy the man who knows","His Master to obey;","Whose life of love and labor flows,","Where God points out the way."],["Rising to every task,","Soon as the word is given,","He doth not wait nor question ask","When orders come from heaven."],["Godâ€™s will he makes his own,","And nothing can him stay;","His feet are shod for God alone,","And God alone obey."],["Give us, O God, this mind,","Which waits but Thy command,","And doth its highest pleasure find","In Thy great work to stand."]]}
