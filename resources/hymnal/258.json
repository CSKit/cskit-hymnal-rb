{"number":258,"title":"TON-Y-BOTEL","composer":"Welsh Hymn Melody","verses":[["Oft to every man and nation","Comes the moment to decide,","In the strife of Truth with falsehood,","For the good or evil side.","A great cause, God’s new Messiah,","Shows to each the bloom or blight,","So can choice be made by all men","Twixt the darkness and the light."],["New occasions teach new duties,","Time makes ancient creeds uncouth;","They must upward still and onward","Who would keep abreast of Truth,","And serenely down the future","See the thought of men incline","To the side of perfect justice","And to God’s supreme design."],["Though the cause of evil prosper,","Yet ’tis Truth alone is strong;","Though her portion be the scaffold,","And upon the throne be wrong,","Yet that scaffold sways the future,","And behind the dim unknown","Standeth God within the shadow","Keeping watch above His own."]]}
