{"number":229,"title":"CONSTANCY","composer":"F. Mendelssohn, arr.","verses":[["O Love divine, whose constant beam","Shines on the eyes that will not see,","And waits to bless us while we dream,","Nor leav’st us though we turn from Thee.","Nor bounds, nor clime, nor creed Thou know’st,","Wide as our need Thy favors fall;","The white wings of the Holy Ghost","Stoop unseen o’er the heads of all."],["O Truth which sage and prophet saw,","Long sought without, but found within,","The rule of Love beyond all law,","The Life o’ercoming death and sin,","O shine on us with light which glowed","Upon the waiting shepherds’ way,","Who saw the darkness overflowed","With tides of everlasting day."]]}
