Wooldridge","verses":[["O Lord, I would delight in Thee,","And on Thy care depend;","To Thee in every trouble flee,","My best, my ever Friend.","When all material streams are dried,","Thy fullness is the same;","May I with this be satisfied,","And glory in Thy name."],["All good, whereâ€™er it may be found,","Its source doth find in Thee;","I must have all things and abound,","While God is God to me.","O that I had a stronger faith,","To look within the veil,","To credit what my Saviour saith,","Whose word can never fail."],["He that has made my heaven secure,","Will here all good provide;","While Christ is rich, can I be poor?","What can I want beside?","O God, I cast my care on Thee;","I triumph and adore;","Henceforth my great concern shall be","To love and praise Thee more."]]}
