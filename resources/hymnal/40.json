{"number":40,"title":"CONSOLATOR","composer":"Samuel Webbe","verses":[["Come, ye disconsolate, whereâ€™er ye languish,","Here health and peace are found, Life, Truth,and Love;","Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;","Earth has no sorrow but Love can remove."],["Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,","Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure;","Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,","Earth has no sorrow that Love cannot cure."],["Here see the Bread of Life, see waters flowing","Forth from the throne of God, pure from above;","Come to the feast of love, come, ever knowing,","Earth has no sorrow but Love can remove."]]}
