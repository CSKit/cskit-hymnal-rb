Walford Davies","verses":[["Speak gently, it is better far","To rule by love than fear;","Speak gently, let no harsh word mar","The good we may do here."],["Speak gently to the erring ones,","They must have toiled in vain;","Perchance unkindness made them so;","O win them back again."],["Speak gently, ’tis a little thing,","Dropped in the heart’s deep well;","The good, the joy that it may bring,","Eternity shall tell."]]}
