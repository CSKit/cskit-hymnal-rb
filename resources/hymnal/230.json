Norman Greenwood","verses":[["O Love, O Life, our faith and sight","Thy presence maketh one;","As, through transfigured clouds of white,","We trace the noonday sun."],["We faintly hear, we dimly see,","In differing phrase we pray;","But, dim or clear, we own in Thee","The Light, the Truth, the Way."],["To do Thy will is more than praise,","As words are less than deeds;","And simple trust can find Thy ways","We miss with chart of creeds."],["Our friend, our brother, and our Lord,","What may thy service be?","Nor name, nor form, nor ritual word,","But simply following thee."]]}
