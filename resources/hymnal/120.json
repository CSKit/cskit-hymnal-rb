Michael Haydn","verses":[["How beauteous on the mountains","The feet of him that brings,","Like streams from living fountains,","Good tidings of good things;","That publishes salvation;","From error gives release","To every tribe and nation:","Godâ€™s reign of joy and peace."],["Break forth in hymns of gladness,","O waste Jerusalem;","Let songs instead of sadness,","Thy jubilee proclaim;","The Lord, in strength victorious,","Upon thy foes has trod;","Behold, O earth, the glorious","Salvation of our God."]]}
