COLUMBA","composer":"Old Irish Hymn Melody","verses":[["There are none friendless, none afraid,","The saving Truth who know,","Their shining path leads from the shade,","And up to light they go."],["It setteth free from thought of sin,","It healeth sorrow’s blight,","Immortal joy is found therein,","And there shall be no night."],["And O, may we, God’s children true,","His healing love make known,","And see by faith all things made new","When ruled by Love alone."]]}
