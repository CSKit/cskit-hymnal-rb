Bach","verses":[["Here, O God, Thy healing presence","Lifts our thoughts from self and sin,","Fills with light their hidden places,","When Thy love is welcomed in.","Here Thy tender sweet persuasions","Turn us home to heavenly ways,","While our hearts, unsealed, adoring,","Pour the fragrance of Thy praise."],["Reverent lives unveil Thy beauty,","Faithful witness bear of Thee;","Binding up the broken-hearted,","We reflect Thy radiancy.","So may deeper consecration","Show Thee forth in healing’s sign,","Till through joyful self-surrender","We in Love’s pure likeness shine."]]}
