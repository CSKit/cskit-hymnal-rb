{"number":176,"title":"CHURCH","composer":"Ludvig M. Lindeman","verses":[["Long hast thou stood, O church of God,","Long mid the tempest’s assailing,","Founded secure on timeless rock","Rises thy light, never failing;","Shining that all may understand","What has been wrought by God’s command,","O’er night and chaos prevailing."],["Let there be light, and light was there,","Clear as the Word that declared it;","Healing and peace to all it gave,","Who in humility shared it.","Ah, they were faithful, they who heard,","Steadfast their trust in God’s great Word,","Steadfast the Love that prepared it."],["Let there be light, the Word shines forth,","Lo, where the new morning whitens;","O church of God, with Book unsealed,","How its page beacons and brightens.","Living stones we, each in his place,","May we be worthy such a grace,","While Truth the wide earth enlightens."]]}
