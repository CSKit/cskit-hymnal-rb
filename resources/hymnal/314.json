Smith","verses":[["Sow in the morn thy seed,","At eve hold not thy hand;","To doubt and fear give thou no heed;","Broadcast it o’er the land."],["It duly shall appear","In verdure, beauty, strength,","The tender blade, the stalk, the ear;","The full corn comes at length."],["The harvest now is white;","Lift up thine eyes, behold,","Illumed by Love’s transforming light,","God’s blessings manifold."]]}
