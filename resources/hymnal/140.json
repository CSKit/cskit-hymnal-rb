OLAVE","composer":"Robert Hudson","verses":[["If on our daily course, our mind","Be set to hallow all we find,","New treasures still, of countless price,","God will provide for sacrifice."],["Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,","As more of heaven in each we see;","Some softening gleam of love and prayer","Shall dawn on every cross and care."],["New mercies, each returning day,","Around us hover while we pray;","Old fears are past, old sins forgiven,","New thoughts of God reveal our heaven."]]}
