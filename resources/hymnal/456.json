{"number":456,"title":"HOW TO SOW","composer":"Robert Rockabrand","verses":[["Shepherd, show me how to go","O’er the hillside steep,","How to gather, how to sow,—","How to feed Thy sheep;","I will listen for Thy voice,","Lest my footsteps stray;","I will follow and rejoice","All the rugged way."],["Thou wilt bind the stubborn will,","Wound the callous breast,","Make self-righteousness be still,","Break earth’s stupid rest.","Strangers on a barren shore,","Lab’ring long and lone,","We would enter by the door,","And Thou know’st Thine own;"],["So, when day grows dark and cold,","Tear or triumph harms,","Lead Thy lambkins to the fold,","Take them in Thine arms;","Feed the hungry, heal the heart,","Till the morning’s beam;","White as wool, ere they depart,","Shepherd, wash them clean."]]}
