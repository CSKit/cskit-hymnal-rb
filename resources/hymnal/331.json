{"number":331,"title":"ST. SEPULCHRE","composer":"George Cooper","verses":[["The lifted eye and bended knee","Are but vain homage, Lord, to Thee;","In vain our lips Thy praise prolong,","The heart a stranger to the song."],["The pure, the humble, contrite mind,","Sincere and to Thy will resigned,","To Thee a nobler offering yields","Than Sheba’s groves or Sharon’s fields."],["Love God and man: this great command","Doth on eternal pillars stand;","This did Thine ancient prophets teach,","And this Thy Well-Beloved preach."]]}
