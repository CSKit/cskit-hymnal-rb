CalkinOrlando Gibbons","verses":[["One holy church of God appears","Through every age and race,","Unwasted by the lapse of years,","Unchanged by changing place."],["From oldest time, on farthest shores,","Beneath the pine or palm,","One unseen presence she adores,","With silence or with psalm."],["Her priests are all Godâ€™s faithful sons,","To serve the world raised up;","The pure in heart her baptized ones;","Love, her communion cup."]]}
