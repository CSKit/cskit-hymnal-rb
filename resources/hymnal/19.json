{"number":19,"title":"PURITY","composer":"Norwegian Folk Melody","verses":[["Behold, they stand in robes of white","Who out of tribulation came,","With songs of joy upon their heads,","They praise His holy name.","O these are they whose hearts are pure,","And free from sin or any stain,","They stand before the throne of light,","Their joy shall never wane."],["They worship Him in spirit new,","Godâ€™s messengers of Love and Life,","They do His will, they speak His Word,","That stills all pain and strife.","They show an ever clearer light,","Like stars they shall forever shine;","They witness truly to His Word,","And God saith, These are Mine."]]}
