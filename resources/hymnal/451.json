{"number":451,"title":"SHERWOOD","composer":"Peter B. Allen","verses":[[" O, sometimes gleams upon our sight,","Through present wrong, th’ eternal right;","And step by step, since time began,"," We see the steady gain of man."],[" For all of good the past hath had","Remains to make our own time glad,","Our common, daily life divine,","And every land a Palestine."],[" Through the harsh noises of our day,","A low sweet prelude finds its way;","Through clouds of doubt and creeds of fear","A light is breaking, calm and clear."],[" Henceforth my heart shall sigh no more","For olden time and holier shore:","God’s love and blessing, then and there,","Are now and here and everywhere."]]}
