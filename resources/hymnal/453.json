{"number":453,"title":"RISE UP","composer":"Peter B. Allen","verses":[["Rise up and walk, take up your bed.","With these few words the sickness fled.","Stretch forth your hand. Receive your sight.","Jesus’ commands reveal God’s might.","You are God’s purpose, His great design.","Beautiful, blameless, His child divine.","Holding your thought to the good and the true,","Spirit will form you anew."],["Cleanse the lepers, heal the sick.","Cast out demons. Raise the dead.","Truth is revealed in every place,","Throughout all time, throughout all space.","Right in this moment, doing God’s will","“These works shall you do, and greater still.”","Standing triumphant upon holy ground,","Songs of the angels resound."]]}
