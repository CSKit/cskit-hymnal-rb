{"number":203,"title":"FIRMAMENT","composer":"H. Walford Davies","verses":[["O Father, may we bear each hour","The flag of hope and peace unfurled,","And mirror forth Love’s sacred power","To feed and bless a hungry world.","We shall not falter by the way","If we but place our trust in Thee,","Obeying gladly day by day","The living Truth that makes men free."],["Help us to know that all is well","E’en though we wander through earth’s shade,","To know that all Thy children dwell","Within Love’s stronghold unafraid.","Teach us to follow fearlessly","The way our gentle Master trod,","’Twill lead us safely home to Thee,","O loving Father-Mother, God."]]}
