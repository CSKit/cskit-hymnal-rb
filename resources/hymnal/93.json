{"number":93,"title":"PEACE","composer":"Arr. from W. A. Mozart","verses":[["Happy the man whose heart can rest,","Assured God’s goodness ne’er will cease;","Each day, complete, with joy is blessed,","God keepeth him in perfect peace."],["God keepeth him, and God is one,","One Life, forevermore the same,","One Truth unchanged while ages run;","Eternal Love His holiest name."],["Dwelling in Love that cannot change,","From anxious fear man finds release;","No more his homeless longings range,","God keepeth him in perfect peace."],["In perfect peace, with tumult stilled,","Enhavened where no storms arise,","There man can work what God hath willed;","The joy of perfect work his prize."]]}
