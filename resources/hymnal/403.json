{"number":403,"title":"BALERMA","composer":"Spanish Melody","verses":[["How sweet, how heavenly is the sight,","When those who love the Lord","In one another’s peace delight,","And so fulfill His word;"],["When, free from envy, scorn, and pride,","Our wishes all above,","Each can his brother’s failings hide,","And show a brother’s love."],["Let love, in one delightful stream,","Through every bosom flow;","And union sweet, and dear esteem","In every action glow."],["Love is the golden chain that binds","The hearts that faithful prove;","And he’s an heir of heaven who finds","His bosom glow with love."]]}
