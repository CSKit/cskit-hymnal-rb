{"number":43,"title":"ABENDLIED","composer":"Franz Schubert","verses":[["Come unto me, ye weary,","And I will give you rest.","O tender words of Jesus,","Which come to hearts oppressed.","They tell of benediction,","Of pardon, grace, and peace,","Of joy that hath no ending,","Of love which cannot cease."],["Come unto me, ye wanderers,","And I will give you light.","O loving words of Jesus,","Which come to cheer the night.","Come, all ye heavy laden,","And I will give you life.","O peaceful words of Jesus,","Which come to end all strife."]]}
