Lindeman","verses":[["Quiet, Lord, my froward heart,","Make me gentle, pure, and mild,","Upright, simple, free from art;","Make me as a little child,","From distrust and envy free,","Pleased with all that pleaseth Thee."],["What Thou shalt today provide","Let me as a child receive,","What tomorrow may betide","Calmly to Thy wisdom leave;","â€™Tis enough that Thou wilt care,","Why should I the burden bear?"],["As a little child relies","On a care beyond its own,","Being neither strong nor wise,","Will not take a step alone,","Let me thus with Thee abide,","As my Father, Friend, and Guide."]]}
