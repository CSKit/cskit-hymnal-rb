Lindeman","verses":[["Love is life’s true crown and glory,","Love the splendor of the light,","Truly is God’s counsel gentle,","Truly all His ways are bright;","Jesus knew the law of kindness,","Healing mind and heart of blindness;","And in heavenly wisdom taught","Holy works of love he wrought."],["Love, the Golden Rule of living,","Showeth forth the perfect Mind;","Love, our debt to God who gives it,","All compassion is, and kind;","Charity the law fulfilleth,","Mid the nations rancor stilleth;","Loving hearts in friendship blend,","One in Him, our heavenly Friend."]]}
