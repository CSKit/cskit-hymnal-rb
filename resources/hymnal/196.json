{"number":196,"title":"DAY OF REST","composer":"James W. Elliott","verses":[["Now is the time approaching,","By prophets long foretold,","When all shall dwell together,","One Shepherd and one fold.","Now Jew and Gentile, meeting","From many a distant shore,","Around one altar kneeling,","One common Lord adore."],["Let all that now divides us","Remove and pass away,","Like shadows of the morning","Before the blaze of day.","Let all that now unites us","More sweet and lasting prove,","A closer bond of union,","In a blest land of love."]]}
