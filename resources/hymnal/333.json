{"number":333,"title":"ABRIDGE","composer":"Isaac Smith","verses":[["The loving friend to all who bowed","Beneath lifeâ€™s weary load,","From lips baptized in humble prayer,","His consolations flowed."],["The faithful witness to the truth,","His just rebuke was hurled","Out from a heart that burned to break","The fetters of the world."],["No hollow rite, no lifeless creed,","His piercing glance could bear;","But longing hearts which sought him found","That God and heaven were there."]]}
