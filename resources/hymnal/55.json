Ludwig Steiner","verses":[["Father, hear the prayer we offer;","Not for ease that prayer shall be,","But for strength, that we may ever","Live our lives courageously."],["Not forever in green pastures","Do we ask our way to be,","But the steep and rugged pathway","May we tread rejoicingly."],["Not forever by still waters","Would we idly quiet stay,","But would smite the living fountains","From the rocks along our way."]]}
