{"number":18,"title":"LYONS","composer":"J. Michael Haydn","verses":[["Be firm and be faithful; desert not the right;","The brave become bolder the darker the night.","Then up and be doing, though cowards may fail;","Thy duty pursuing, dare all and prevail."],["If scorn be thy portion, if hatred and loss,","If stripes or a prison, remember the cross.","God watches above thee, and He will requite;","Forsake those that love thee, but never the right."]]}
