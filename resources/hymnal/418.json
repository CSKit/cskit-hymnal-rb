{"number":418,"title":"ETERNITY","composer":"P. P. Bliss","verses":[["O, the clanging bells of time,","Night and day they never cease;","We are wearied with their chime,","For they do not bring us peace;","And we hush our breath to hear,","And we strain our eyes to see","If thy shores are drawing near,","Eternity! Eternity!"],["O, the clanging bells of time,","How their changes rise and fall,","But in undertone sublime,","Sounding clearly through them all,","Is a voice that must be heard,","As our moments onward flee,","And it speaketh, aye, one word,","Eternity! Eternity!"],["O, the clanging bells of time,","To their voices, loud and low,","In a long, unresting line","We are marching to and fro;","And we yearn for sight or sound","Of the life that is to be,","For thy breath doth wrap us round,","Eternity! Eternity!"],["O, the clanging bells of time,","Soon their notes will all be dumb,","And in joy and peace sublime,","We shall feel the silence come;","And our souls their thirst will slake,","And our eyes the King will see,","When thy glorious morn shall break,","Eternity! Eternity!"]]}
