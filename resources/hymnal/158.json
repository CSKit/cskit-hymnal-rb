Walford Davies","verses":[["It came upon the midnight clear,","That glorious song of old,","The angels, bending near the earth,","Their wondrous story told","Of peace on earth, good will to men,","From heaven’s all-gracious King;","The world in solemn stillness lay","To hear the angels sing."],["O ye beneath life’s crushing load","Whose forms are bending low,","Who toil along the climbing way","With painful steps and slow;","Look now, for glad and golden hours","Come swiftly on the wing;","O rest beside the weary road,","And hear the angels sing."],["For lo, the days are hastening on,","By prophets seen of old,","When with the ever-circling years","Shall come the time foretold;","When the new heaven and earth shall own","The Prince of Peace their King,","And all the world send back the song","Which now the angels sing."]]}
