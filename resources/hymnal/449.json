{"number":449,"title":"ENDLESS SONG","composer":"Robert Lowry","verses":[[" My life flows on in endless song;","Above earth’s lamentation;","I hear the sweet though far-off hymn","That hails a new creation:","Through all the tumult and the strife","I hear the music ringing,","It finds an echo in my soul,","How can I keep from singing?"],[" What though my human comforts die?","The Lord my Savior liveth;","What though the darkness gather round!","Songs in the night He giveth:","No storm can shake my inmost calm","While to that Rock I’m clinging,","Since Love is Lord of heav’n and earth,","How can I keep from singing?"],[" I lift mine eyes, the cloud grows thin,","I see the blue above it;","And day by day this pathway smooths","Since first I learned to love it:","The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,","A fountain ever springing,","All things are mine since I am His,","How can I keep from singing?"]]}
