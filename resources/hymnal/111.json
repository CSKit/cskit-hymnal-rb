Garrett","verses":[["High in the heavens, eternal God,","Thy goodness in full glory shines;","Thy truth shall break through every cloud","That veils and darkens Thy designs."],["Forever firm Thy justice stands,","As mountains their foundations keep:","How wise the wonders of Thy hands;","Thy judgments are a mighty deep."],["Life, like a fountain rich and free,","Springs from the presence of my Lord;","And in Thy light we all shall see","The glories promised in Thy Word."]]}
