{"number":363,"title":"PHILIPPINE","composer":"R. E. Roberts","verses":[["Upon the Gospel’s sacred page","The gathered beams of ages shine;","And, as it hastens, every age","But makes its brightness more divine."],["On mightier wing, in loftier flight,","From year to year does knowledge soar;","And, as it soars, the Gospel light","Becomes effulgent more and more."],["More glorious still, as centuries roll,","New regions blest, new powers unfurled,","So Truth reveals the perfect whole,","Its radiance shall o’erflow the world,—"],["Shall flow to bless but not destroy;","As when the cloudless lamp of day","Pours out its floods of light and joy,","And sweeps the lingering mist away."]]}
