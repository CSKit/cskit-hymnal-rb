Christian Hoffman","verses":[["As gold by fire is tested,","Its purity shown forth,","So cleansing fires of Truth may prove","To man his native worth."],["And as a mirror shows us","A likeness clear and bright,","So God forever sees His child","Revealed in radiant light."],["’Twas thus the loving Master","Saw man’s perfection shine,","Beheld God’s child forever pure","In radiance all divine."]]}
