Walford Davies","verses":[["O Love, our Mother, ever near,","To Thee we turn from doubt and fear!","In perfect peace our thoughts abide;","Our hearts now in this truth confide:","Man is the child of God."],["O Light, in Thy light we can see","That man is ever one with Thee.","In love our lives Thou dost enfold,","And now our waiting hopes behold","That man is Godâ€™s own child."],["O joy that ever will remain,","Midst seeming sorrow, hate, and pain,","Our hearts to fill with this glad song","That soars above the mists of wrong:","Man is the loved of Love."]]}
