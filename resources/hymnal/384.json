{"number":384,"title":"MORNING HYMN","composer":"Francois H. Barthélémon","verses":[["When God is seen with men to dwell,","And all creation makes anew,","What tongue can half the wonders tell,","What eye the dazzling glories view?"],["Celestial streams shall gently flow,","The wilderness shall joyful be;","On parched ground shall lilies grow","And gladness spring on every tree;"],["The weak be strong, the fearful bold,","The deaf shall hear, the dumb shall sing,","The lame shall walk, the blind behold,","And joy through all the earth shall ring."]]}
