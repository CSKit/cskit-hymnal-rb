{"number":57,"title":"WELWYN","composer":"Alfred Scott-Gatty","verses":[["Father, to Thee we turn away from sorrow,","Thou art the fountain whence our healing flows;","Dark though the night, joy cometh with the morrow;","Safely they rest who on Thy love repose."],["Should fond hopes fail and skies seem dark before us,","Should the vain cares that vex our days increase,","Comes with its calm the thought that Thou art o’er us;","Then we grow quiet, folded in Thy peace."],["Naught shall affright us, on Thy goodness leaning;","Low in the heart faith singeth still her song;","Chastened and blessed we learn life’s deeper meaning,","Thus in our meekness Thou dost make us strong."]]}
