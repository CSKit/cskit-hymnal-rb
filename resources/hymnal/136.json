{"number":136,"title":"HEAVENWARD","composer":"Irish Melody","verses":[["I love Thy way of freedom, Lord,","To serve Thee is my choice,","In Thy clear light of Truth I rise","And, listening for Thy voice,","I hear Thy promise old and new,","That bids all fear to cease:","My presence still shall go with thee","And I will give thee peace."],["Though storm or discord cross my path","Thy power is still my stay,","Though human will and woe would check","My upward-soaring way;","All unafraid I wait, the while","Thy angels bring release,","For still Thy presence is with me,","And Thou dost give me peace."],["I climb, with joy, the heights of Mind,","To soar oâ€™er time and space;","I yet shall know as I am known","And see Thee face to face.","Till time and space and fear are naught","My quest shall never cease,","Thy presence ever goes with me","And Thou dost give me peace."]]}
