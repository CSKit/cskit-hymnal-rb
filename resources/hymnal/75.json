{"number":75,"title":"AURELIA","composer":"Samuel S. Wesley","verses":[["God comes, with succor speedy,","To those who suffer wrong;","To help the poor and needy,","And bid the weak be strong;","He comes to break oppression,","To set the captive free,","To take away transgression,","And rule in equity."],["His blessings come as showers","Upon the thirsty earth;","And joy and hope, like flowers,","Spring in His path to birth.","Before Him on the mountains","Shall Peace, the herald, go;","From hill to vale the fountains","Of righteousness shall flow."],["To Him shall prayer unceasing,","And daily vows, ascend;","His kingdom still increasing,","A kingdom without end.","The tide of time shall never","His covenant remove;","His name shall stand forever:","His changeless name of Love."]]}
