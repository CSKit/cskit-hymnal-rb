{"number":174,"title":"CONSOLATION","composer":"F. Mendelssohn, arr.","verses":[["Like as a mother, God comforteth His children;","Comfort is calm, that bids all tumult cease;","Comfort is hope and courage for endeavor,","Comfort is love, whose home abides in peace."],["Love is true solace and giveth joy for sorrow,—","O, in that light, all earthly loss is gain;","Joy must endure, Love’s giving is forever;","Life is of God, whose radiance cannot wane."],["O holy presence, that stills all our demanding,","O love of God, that needs but to be known!","Heaven is at hand, when thy pure touch persuades us,","Comfort of God, that seeks and finds His own."]]}
