{"number":41,"title":"QUI LABORAT ORAT","composer":"Hugh P. Allen","verses":[["Come, labor on:","Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain?","While all around him waves the golden grain,","And to each servant does the Master say,","Go work today."],["Come, labor on:","Claim the high calling that we all may share;","To all the world the joyful tidings bear;","Redeem the time: its hours too swiftly fly,","Harvest draws nigh."],["Come, labor on:","Away with gloomy doubts and faithless fear.","No arm so weak but may do service here;","By means the simplest can our God fulfill","His righteous will."],["Come, labor on:","The toil is pleasant, the reward is sure;","Blessed are they who to the end endure;","How full their joy, how sweet their rest shall be,","O Lord, with Thee."]]}
