Zinck (?)","verses":[["How wondrous is Thy mercy, Lord,","How faithful is Thy kindness.","Thou gavâ€™st the treasure of Thy Word;","That Word dispels all blindness.","Thou holdest all things in Thy sight,","For in Thy presence is no night,","And in Thy light shall we see light."],["Thy judgments are a mighty deep,","Thy wisdom past all seeking;","Thou watchest when we lie asleep,","We trust us to Thy keeping.","Thy love doth every blessing shower;","It rests alike on man and flower:","The whole creation owns Thy power."]]}
