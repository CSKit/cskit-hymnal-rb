{"number":242,"title":"CAPEL","composer":"English Traditional Carol Melody","verses":[["O, still in accents sweet and strong","Sounds forth the ancient word:","More reapers for white harvest fields,","More laborers for the Lord."],["We hear the call; no more in dreams","And selfish ease we lie,","But girded for our Fatherâ€™s work,","Go forth beneath His sky."],["O Thou whose call our hearts hath stirred,","To do Thy will we come,","Thrust in our sickles at Thy word,","And bear our harvest home."]]}
