{"number":171,"title":"ALLELUIA","composer":"Samuel S. Wesley","verses":[["Let us sing of Easter gladness","That rejoices every day,","Sing of hope and faith uplifted;","Love has rolled the stone away.","Lo, the promise and fulfillment,","Lo, the man whom God hath made,","Seen in glory of an Easter","Crowned with light that cannot fade."],["When we touch Truth’s healing garment","And behold Life’s purity,","When we find in Love the refuge","That is man’s security,","When we turn from earth to Spirit,","And from self have won release,","Then we see the risen Saviour;","Then we know his promised peace."],["Living meekly as the Master,","Who of God was glorified,","Looking ever to the radiance","Of his wondrous Eastertide;","Freed of fear, of pain, and sorrow,","Giving God the honor due,","Every day will be an Easter","Filled with benedictions new."]]}
