{"number":452,"title":"NEWFOUND","composer":"Susan Mack","verses":[[" O Thou unchanging Truth, whose facts eternal","give us the courage to outface the storm,","to rise against the senses’ swift alarm","and stand unmoved at Spirit’s high tribunal,","Thy Word acquits us and Thy Word is final."],[" O Thou abundant Life, whose freshness daily","admits no common round, no dull routine,","this is our joy and this our discipline,","to take Thy gift of life and use it fully;","this is our highest task, to spend it freely."],[" O Thou, O boundless Love, forever undiminished,","how far and little seems the lie of pain.","We were with Thee, before the world began, and","shall be with Thee, when the world has vanished;","Thy work is perfect and Thy work is finished."]]}
