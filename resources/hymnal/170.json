{"number":170,"title":"CREATION","composer":"Franz Joseph Haydn","verses":[["Let every creature hail the morn","On which the holy child was born,","And know, through Godâ€™s exceeding grace,","Release from things of time and place.","I listen, from no mortal tongue,","To hear the song the angels sung,","And wait within myself to know","The Christmas lilies bud and blow."],["The outward symbols disappear","From him whose inward sight is clear,","And small must be the choice of days","To him who fills them all with praise.","Keep while ye need it, brothers mine,","With honest zeal your Christmas sign,","But judge not him who every morn","Feels in his heart the Lord Christ born."]]}
