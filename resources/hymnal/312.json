{"number":312,"title":"DIADEMATA","composer":"George J. Elvey","verses":[["Soldiers of Christ, arise,","And put your armor on,","Strong in the strength which God supplies","Through His eternal Son.","Stand then in His great might,","With all His strength endued,","And take, to arm you for the fight,","The panoply of God."],["From strength to strength go on;","O wrestle, fight, and pray;","Tread all the powers of darkness down,","And win the well-fought day.","That, having all things done,","And all your conflicts past,","Ye may oâ€™ercome through Christ alone,","And stand complete at last."]]}
