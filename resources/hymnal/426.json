{"number":426,"title":" JEHOVAH ","composer":"Edward John Hopkins","verses":[["In Love divine all earth-born fear and sorrow","Fade as the dark when dawn pours forth her light;","And understanding prayer is fully answered,","When trustingly we turn to God aright."],["And as on wings of faith we soar and worship,","Held by God’s love above the shadows dim,","Hushed in the grandeur of a heart’s awakening,","Unfolds a joy unknown till found in Him."],["Then in this radiant light of adoration,","We know that man beloved is in God’s care,","Not wrapt in fear nor bowed with tired labor,","But satisfied, complete, divinely fair."]]}
