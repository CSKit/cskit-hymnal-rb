{"number":458,"title":"O WALY, WALY","composer":"Scottish folk song","verses":[[" Though I may speak with moving words,","Which can inspire the heart of man,","But have no love to seal their worth,","They are but emptiness and sham."],[" Though I may give my worldly goods","Without a thought of self or gain,","Unless they bear the fruits of love","They are as clouds without their rain."],[" Though I may search the deepest books,","Companion with the wisest men,","Godâ€™s loving voice still calls to me,","It bids me turn and look again."],[" Now I would learn to know this Love","Through meek and patient ministry,","Until my life has grown anew","And Love is All-in-all to me."]]}
