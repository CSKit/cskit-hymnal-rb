{"number":200,"title":"SWANAGE","composer":"E. Norman Greenwood","verses":[["O daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness;","Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more;","And bright o’er thy hills dawns the daystar of gladness;","Arise, for the night of thy sorrow is o’er."],["O many thy foes, but the arm that subdued them","And scattered their legions was mightier far;","They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them,","For vain were their steeds and their chariots of war."],["O daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee,","Extolled with the harp and the timbrel should be;","Then shout, for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee;","Th’ oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free."]]}
