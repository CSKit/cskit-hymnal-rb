{"number":222,"title":"ST. LOUISCHRISTMAS CAROL","composer":"Lewis H. RednerH. Walford Davies","verses":[["O little town of Bethlehem,","How still we see thee lie;","Above thy deep and dreamless sleep","The silent stars go by;","Yet in thy dark streets shineth","The everlasting Light;","The hopes and fears of all the years","Are met in thee tonight."],["O morning stars, together","Proclaim the holy birth,","And praises sing to God the King,","And peace to men on earth;","Where charity stands watching","And faith holds wide the door,","The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,","And Christmas comes once more."],["How silently, how silently,","The wondrous gift is given;","So God imparts to human hearts","The blessings of His heaven.","No ear may hear his coming,","But in this world of sin,","Where meekness will receive him, still","The dear Christ enters in."]]}
