{"number":7,"title":"EVENTIDE","composer":"William H. Monk","verses":[["Abide with me; fast breaks the morning light;","Our daystar rises, banishing all night;","Thou art our strength, O Truth that maketh free,","We would unfailingly abide in Thee."],["I know no fear, with Thee at hand to bless,","Sin hath no power and life no wretchedness;","Health, hope and love in all around I see","For those who trustingly abide in Thee."],["I know Thy presence every passing hour,","I know Thy peace, for Thou alone art power;","O Love divine, abiding constantly,","I need not plead, Thou dost abide with me."]]}
