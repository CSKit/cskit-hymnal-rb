{"number":54,"title":"WESTMINSTER","composer":"James Turle","verses":[["Faith grasps the blessing she desires,","Hope points the upward gaze;","And Love, celestial Love, inspires","The eloquence of praise."],["But sweeter far the still small voice","Unheard by human ear,","When God has made the heart rejoice,","And dried the bitter tear."],["No accents flow, no words ascend;","All utterance faileth there;","But God Himself doth comprehend","And answer silent prayer."]]}
