Bach","verses":[["Trust all to God, the Father,","Confide thou in none other,","He is thy sole defense;","He cares for thee past measure,","Seek Him who has thy treasure,","Thy helper is omnipotence."],["Behold His works of wonder,","Yea, all His doings ponder,","Else is thy toil in vain;","Thy caring and contriving,","Thy taking thought and striving","Are naught unless the Lord ordain."],["God lights the way of duty,","And gives, for ashes, beauty,","And naught His hand delays;","Who trusts in His providing,","All glad in this confiding,","Is he who without ceasing prays."]]}
