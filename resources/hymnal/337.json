BrownEnglish Traditional Melody, arr.","verses":[["Theories, which thousands cherish,","Pass like clouds that sweep the sky;","Creeds and dogmas all may perish;","Truth Herself can never die."],["Worldlings blindly may refuse Her,","Close their eyes and call it night;","Learned scoffers may abuse Her,","But they cannot quench Her light."],["Thrones may totter, empires crumble,","All their glories cease to be;","While She, Christlike, crowns the humble,","And from bondage sets them free."]]}
