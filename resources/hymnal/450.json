{"number":450,"title":"MORA PROCTOR","composer":"William J. Reynolds","verses":[[" O house of God, built on a firm foundation,","Standing secure amid the storms of life,","Where all may come to learn of true salvation","And find release from discord, pain, and strife."],[" We hear the Word, in song and sermon spoken,","In silent prayer, we turn to God today;","Our humble hearts receive the blessed token","Of Truth that guides us in the upward way."],[" O Father, feed us with Thy bread from heaven,","The living water, may we drink of Thee,","And every lesson which Thy love hath given","Oh, may we learn it with humility."],[" We feel Thy peace, Thine arms of Love enfolding,","We lift our hearts in praise and gratitude,","And from this hour, a glimpse of heaven beholding,","Go forth at last, our joy and strength renewed."]]}
