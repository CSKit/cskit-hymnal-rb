{"number":11,"title":"SALZBURG","composer":"Jakob Hintze","verses":[["Angels at the Saviour’s birth","Woke with music all the earth,","Shepherds in the eastern sky","Saw a pale star passing by,","Guiding them at break of day","Where the babe in meekness lay,","Born the gracious news to tell,","God with us, Immanuel."],["Star of being, still thy light","Shines before us in the night,","By those radiant beams we find","Christ, the Truth, for all mankind,","Still the tidings angels bring","With their joyful caroling,","Telling that the dawn has come,","God and man fore’er at one."]]}
