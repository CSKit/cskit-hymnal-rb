Parry","verses":[["Dear Lord and Father of us all,","Forgive our foolish ways;","Reclothe us in our rightful mind;","In purer lives Thy service find,","In deeper reverence, praise."],["In simple trust like theirs who heard,","Beside the Syrian sea,","The gracious calling of the Lord,","Let us, like them, without a word","Rise up and follow thee."],["Breathe through the pulses of desire","Thy coolness and Thy balm;","Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;","Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire,","O still small voice of calm."],["Drop Thy still dews of quietness,","Till all our strivings cease;","Take from us now the strain and stress,","And let our ordered lives confess","The beauty of Thy peace."]]}
