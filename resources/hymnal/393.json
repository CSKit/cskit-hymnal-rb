Peter","verses":[["With love and peace and joy supreme","We hail the new appearing;","From out the darkness and the dream,","The haven of rest is nearing."],["With gifts of healing in his wings","To light the Christ now guides us,","The heart that knows him burns and sings,","For endless joy betides us."],["His touch the door of Life unseals","And bids us freely enter,","His word the heaven of heavens reveals","With Love its bound and center."],["For God is all, and Christ the way;","Our meek and bold defender","Has cleft the night and lo, the day","Bursts forth in mighty splendor."]]}
