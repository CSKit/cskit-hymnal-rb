{"number":64,"title":"ELGIN","composer":"George Dyson","verses":[["From sense to Soul my pathway lies before me,","From mist and shadow into Truth’s clear day;","The dawn of all things real is breaking o’er me,","My heart is singing: I have found the way."],["I reach Mind’s open door, and at its portal","I know that where I stand is holy ground;","I feel the calm and joy of things immortal,","The loveliness of Love is all around."],["The way leads upward and its goal draws nearer,","Thought soars enraptured, fetterless and free;","The vision infinite to me grows clearer,","I touch the fringes of eternity."]]}
