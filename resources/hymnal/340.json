Carter","verses":[["There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,","Like the wideness of the sea;","There’s a kindness in His justice,","Which is more than liberty."],["For the love of God is broader","Than is seen by human mind,","And the heart of the Eternal","Is most wonderfully kind."],["If our love were but more simple,","We should take Him at His word;","And our lives would be all sunshine","In the sweetness of our Lord."]]}
