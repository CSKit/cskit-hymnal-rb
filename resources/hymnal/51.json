{"number":51,"title":"SPOHRST. MATTHEW","composer":"Louis SpohrWilliam Croft","verses":[["Eternal Mind the Potter is,","And thought th’ eternal clay:","The hand that fashions is divine,","His works pass not away.","Man is the noblest work of God,","His beauty, power and grace,","Immortal; perfect as his Mind","Reflected face to face."],["God could not make imperfect man","His model infinite;","Unhallowed thought He could not plan,","Love’s work and Love must fit.","Life, Truth and Love the pattern make,","Christ is the perfect heir;","The clouds of sense roll back, and show","The form divinely fair."],["God’s will is done; His kingdom come;","The Potter’s work is plain.","The longing to be good and true","Has brought the light again.","And man does stand as God’s own child,","The image of His love.","Let gladness ring from every tongue,","And heaven and earth approve."]]}
