{"number":85,"title":"LIEBSTER JESU","composer":"Johann R. Ahle","verses":[["God of Truth, eternal good,","Lift our hearts to revelation,","That Thou mayst be understood,","Thou, the Rock of our salvation;","All Thy love we have for loving,","All Thy truth is ours for proving."],["Open now our eyes to see,","As the clouds of sense are riven,","We behold reality,","Know the glory of Thy heaven;","So we seek Thy perfect healing","Through the Truth of Thy revealing."],["All the way that we must go","We will take at Thy direction,","Where the floods of trouble flow","Find Thy perfect, calm reflection;","On the path that has no turning,","Patience, courage, meekness learning."]]}
