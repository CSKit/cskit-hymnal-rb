{"number":228,"title":"MENDON","composer":"Old German Melody","verses":[["O Love divine, that dwells serene,","Whose light of life has no eclipse,","We feel Thy comfort, though unseen,","And lay our hand upon our lips."],["No words our hidden joy can tell,","A welling fount, it fills the heart;","Not in the flesh, in Thee we dwell,","In Thee our life, for Life Thou art."],["With love we meet the low despite","Of such as hate our Masterâ€™s way.","With patience he maintained the right;","So may we triumph day by day."]]}
