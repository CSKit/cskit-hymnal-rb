{"number":128,"title":"WARDILLSLEY","composer":"Scottish MelodyJohn Bishop","verses":[["How sweetly flowed the gospel sound","From lips of gentleness and grace,","When listening thousands gathered round","And joy and reverence filled the place."],["From heaven he came, of heaven he spoke,","To heaven he led his followers’ way.","Dark clouds of gloomy night he broke,","Unveiling Love’s immortal day."],["To wanderers from the Father’s home,","To weary ones he offered rest;","So to his teachings all may come,","Obey them, love them, and be blest."]]}
